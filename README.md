# Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera

This is the complete source code in Jupyter Notebooks for the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera. 

This is the best deep learning course out there. Period. No further explanation neede. If you need the depth of concepts of deep learning,
then this course is definitley for you.

I would however suggest taking other graduate level courses on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing if you want to specialize
in one of those fields. The most famous courses are Computer Vision (CS 231n) from Stanford and Natural Language Processing (CS 224n)
from Stanford.

Cheers!
