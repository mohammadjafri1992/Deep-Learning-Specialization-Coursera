# README

This course contains no projects or notebooks. It contains 2 full length (45 min.) quizzes which, in my opinion, 
carry the most value of this specialization. 

These quizzes make you think like you are actually on the job doing a deep learning project. It also includes hyperparameter
tuning, discusses what to do about the data received during a project, etc.

This was the most fun course of them all.
